You'll need to set some credentials in `secret.env` (probably a good idea to `chmod 600 secret.env`):

```
TODOIST_TOKEN=my_token
DROPBOX_TOKEN=my_token
```

* Get a Todoist token from `Settings/Integrations`
* Get a Dropbox token [here](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
  * Use the "App folder" permission type to limit access to a folder under `/Apps`.
    This means files ostensibly uploaded to the root folder actually end up in the application folder.
